# oui-lookup

A python tool with a basic CLI to interact with the IEEE OUI dataset. The main usecase is easily doing mass lookups via the `splat` option to quickly parse and find wifi cameras or other interesting devices you don't want on your network.

This also doubles as a good starting point for building and interacting with any web-to-sqlite dataset.
